## Pakistan NGO Fraud Detection Dataset
### üìò Overview
This dataset represents financial and operational data collected from multiple Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) operating across Pakistan.
The primary objective of this dataset is to analyze and detect fraudulent activities in NGO project funding and expense reporting.

The data includes information about project proposals, financial requests, bank details, vendors, population demographics, and audit indicators.
It can be used to identify suspicious trends, detect anomalies, and build machine learning models for fraud detection in the non-profit sector.

üß© Dataset Structure

Column Name	Description

- Date:	Date when the project application or transaction was recorded.
- Applicant_Name:	Name of the person or representative applying.
- NGO_Name:	Registered name of the NGO involved in the project.
- City_Town_Village:	Geographical area where the NGO operates or the project takes place.
- Project_Name:	Title or description of the project submitted for funding.
- Requested_Amount_PKR:	The amount requested by the NGO for the project (in PKR).
- Legitimate_Estimate_PKR:	The legitimate or auditor-approved estimate of required funding.
- Fraud_Type:	Indicates whether the project is approved or fraudulent and what kind of fraud occurred.
- Fraud_Indicator:	Qualitative description of audit findings or irregularities.
- Population_Census_Record: Official population data of the area (for demographic comparison).
- Invoice_ID:	Unique identifier for the submitted invoice.
- Vendor_Name:	The vendor or supplier linked with project purchases or reimbursements.
- Bank_Reference_No:	Transaction or reference number associated with NGO's funding transfer.
- Bank_Name:	Bank used by the NGO for fund transfer.
- Is_Fraud:	Boolean field (True/False) indicating if the case was identified as fraud.
- Implied_Fraud_Ratio:	Computed ratio that estimates the scale of fraud relative to project size.

üéØ Purpose of Analysis

This dataset is designed to help data analysts, auditors, and government agencies identify fraud patterns and high-risk NGOs or vendors.
The key goals include:

1- Detecting financial anomalies such as exaggerated funding requests.

2- Understanding geographic and institutional risk factors contributing to fraud.

3- Monitoring bank and vendor activities for repeated fraudulent behavior.

4- Training predictive machine learning models for early fraud detection.

5- Enhancing transparency and accountability in Pakistan‚Äôs non-profit and development sector.

üí° Potential Use Cases

- Fraud Detection Systems: Build models that predict if a project proposal is likely to be fraudulent.
- Audit Dashboards: Visualize NGO activities, high-risk zones, and suspicious transactions.
- Policy Design: Help government agencies strengthen NGO regulations and funding procedures.
- Vendor Screening: Detect vendors repeatedly involved in fraudulent projects.
- Educational Projects: Ideal dataset for learning data cleaning, EDA, and fraud detection with Python or Power BI.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This dataset is synthetic but realistic, created for educational and analytical purposes.
It does not represent any real NGO or individual but mimics actual data patterns observed in NGO funding and fraud audits.
