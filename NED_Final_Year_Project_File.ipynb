        "\n",
        "This notebook presents an exploratory data analysis and an anomaly detection approach using an autoencoder model to identify potential fraudulent activities in the provided Pakistan NGO dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "The initial data exploration revealed the distribution of projects across different NGOs, project types, and cities, providing a foundational understanding of the dataset's structure and content. Visualizations highlighted the frequency of different fraud types and the spatial distribution of projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature engineering involved cleaning numerical data, calculating the \"Fund Gap\" between requested and legitimate amounts, determining \"Funding per Capita\" based on population records, and analyzing \"Bank Frequency\". These engineered features were then used as input for the autoencoder model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The autoencoder was trained on the 'normal' (non-fraudulent) data to learn the typical patterns of legitimate transactions. By calculating the reconstruction error for all data points, the model identified instances that deviate significantly from the learned normal patterns, flagging them as potential anomalies or frauds.\n",
        "\n",
        "The anomaly detection results show a threshold for identifying potential fraud based on reconstruction error. The confusion matrix and classification report provide metrics on the model's performance in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent cases based on the available 'Is_Fraud' labels. While the model shows high precision for detecting fraud, the recall is relatively low, indicating that it identifies a subset of the actual fraudulent cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final visualization provides a pie chart showing the proportion of potentially fraudulent NGOs detected by the model compared to legitimate ones based on the defined threshold. A list of the top detected fraudulent NGOs is also presented.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The autoencoder model can be a valuable tool for anomaly detection in NGO financial data, identifying transactions or projects that deviate from expected patterns.\n",
        "*   Engineered features such as Fund Gap and Funding per Capita can help highlight suspicious activities.\n",
        "*   The current model identified a number of potential fraud cases, but further refinement and potentially more sophisticated models or additional data features could improve the recall and overall performance of the fraud detection system.\n",
        "*   The identified potentially fraudulent NGOs warrant further investigation and auditing.\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis serves as a starting point for building a robust fraud detection system for NGOs in Pakistan, contributing to increased transparency and accountability in the non-profit sector."
